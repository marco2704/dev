Big fan of people who always give everything their best, because thatâ€™s what I do too! Honesty, empathy, and respect for others are the basic values that drive all the aspects of my life.

I'm not only a curious tech lover, but a so proactive one too. That's why I'm currently one of the organizers of the DevOps Meetup of my city, attender of other Meetups and tech/coding conventions, and even a speaker a couple of times with [Jenkins Overview](https://slides.com/marco2704/jenkins-overview#/), and [Troubleshooting Using Jenkins Script Console](https://slides.com/marco2704/troubleshooting-using-jenkins-script-console/#/).

The rest of my time is spent at the gym, learning climbing, hanging out with my friends, chilling with my family or looking for pretty places to travel.
